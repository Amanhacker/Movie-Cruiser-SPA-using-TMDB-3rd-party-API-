## Project Overview

This project contains the website developed using Angular which has different modules like Login, Trending movies, Search module, Logout, Add to Favorites, etc.

I have used the TMDB API for fetching the data of movies (https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/introduction) and once the user gets authenticated, he/she is able to add or remove movie in their favorite list. Also, a user can search any movie based on some keyword.

## Technologies used :

### FrontEnd : 
HTML5, CSS3, Angular, Angular Material, TMDB API

## Steps to run the above Angular Project : 

- Open the project in Visual Studio code and open terminal
- Run "npm install" command to install all the dependencies
- Run "ng serve -o" 
- You are good to go and view the project in the local host 4200.
